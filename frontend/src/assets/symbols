The /BURMALDA/BURMALDA/frontend/src/assets/symbols directory is intended to hold the images or symbols used in the slot machine reels. Since this is a directory, it does not contain any files by default. You can add image files (e.g., PNG, JPG) representing the symbols for your slot machine here.

For now, I will create the directory structure, but the contents will be empty as it is meant for image files. 

This file is intentionally left blank.
